FS_PROMPT = """Question: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Ana, Eve, Ada, Dan, Rob, Amy, and Joe. Dan finished third. Ana finished above Ada. Amy finished last. Dan finished below Rob. Eve finished below Ada. Rob finished below Joe. Options: (A) Ana finished third (B) Eve finished third (C) Ada finished third (D) Dan finished third (E) Rob finished third (F) Amy finished third (G) Joe finished third
Answer: In the golf tournament, Dan finished third is explicitly stated, so the answer is {D}.

Question: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a robin, an owl, a quail, a falcon, a hummingbird, a cardinal, and a crow. The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon. The crow is to the right of the cardinal. The cardinal is the second from the right. The quail is the third from the right. The falcon is to the left of the robin. The owl is the second from the left. Options: (A) The robin is the fourth from the left (B) The owl is the fourth from the left (C) The quail is the fourth from the left (D) The falcon is the fourth from the left (E) The hummingbird is the fourth from the left (F) The cardinal is the fourth from the left (G) The crow is the fourth from the left
Answer: To determine the positions of the birds, we can analyze the given facts step by step: 1. The cardinal is the second from the right: This means the cardinal is in position 6 (since there are 7 positions total). 2. The quail is the third from the right: Since the cardinal is in position 6, the quail must be in position 5. 3. The crow is to the right of the cardinal: Since the cardinal is in position 6, the crow must be in position 7. 4. The owl is the second from the left: This means the owl is in position 2. 5. The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon: The falcon must be in a position to the right of the hummingbird. 6. The falcon is to the left of the robin: This means the falcon must be in a position to the left of the robin.
Now, we can summarize the positions we have so far: 2: Owl 5: Quail 6: Cardinal 7: Crow. Since the owl is in position 2, the only available positions left for the hummingbird, falcon, and robin are 1, 3, and 4.  Now, we can answer the question, the robin is in position 4. The answer is {A}.
