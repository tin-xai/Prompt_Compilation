GSM8K_ONE_STEP_LTM = """Q: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
A: Let's break down this problem:
1. How much money do you receive for the cans?
2. How much money do you receive for the newspapers?
3. How much money do you receive in total?

1. There are 144/12 = 12 sets of 12 cans. So, you receive $0.50 x 12 = $6 for the cans.
2. There are 20/5 = 4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers. So, you receive $1.50 x 4 = $6 for the newspapers.
3. In total, you receive $6 + $6 = $12.

The answer is {12}.

Q: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?
A: Let's break down this problem:
1. How many strawberries did Matthew pick?
2. How many strawberries did Natalie pick?
3. How many strawberries did they have in total?
4. How many jars of jam could they make?
5. How much money did they earn?

1. Matthew picked 20 more than Betty, so Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.
2. Matthew picked twice as many as Natalie, so Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.
3. Together, they have 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries.
4. They can make 70/7 = 10 jars of jam.
5. They earn 10 x $4 = $40.

The answer is {40}."""
