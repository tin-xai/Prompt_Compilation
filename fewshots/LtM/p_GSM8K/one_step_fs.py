GSM8K_ONE_STEP_LTM = """Q: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
A: Let's break down this problem:
1. How much money do you receive for the cans?
2. How much money do you receive for the newspapers?
3. How much money do you receive in total?

1. There are 144/12 = 12 sets of 12 cans. So, you receive $0.50 x 12 = $6 for the cans.
2. There are 20/5 = 4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers. So, you receive $1.50 x 4 = $6 for the newspapers.
3. In total, you receive $6 + $6 = $12.

The answer is {12}.

Q: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?
A: Let's break down this problem:
1. How many strawberries did Matthew pick?
2. How many strawberries did Natalie pick?
3. How many strawberries did they have in total?
4. How many jars of jam could they make?
5. How much money did they earn?

1. Matthew picked 20 more than Betty, so Matthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.
2. Matthew picked twice as many as Natalie, so Natalie picked 36/2 = 18 strawberries.
3. Together, they have 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries.
4. They can make 70/7 = 10 jars of jam.
5. They earn 10 x $4 = $40.

The answer is {40}.

Q: At the beginning of the day, Principal Kumar instructed Harold to raise the flag up the flagpole. The flagpole is 60 feet long, and when fully raised, the flag sits on the very top of the flagpole. Later that morning, Vice-principal Zizi instructed Harold to lower the flag to half-mast. So, Harold lowered the flag halfway down the pole. Later, Principal Kumar told Harold to raise the flag to the top of the pole once again, and Harold did just that. At the end of the day, Vice-principal Zizi instructed Harold to completely lower the flag, take it off of the pole, and put it away for the evening. Over the course of the day, how far, in feet, had the flag moved up and down the pole?
A: Let's break down this problem:
1. How far is half-mast?
2. What are all the movements of the flag?
3. What is the total distance moved?

1. Half-mast is halfway down the 60-foot pole, so half-mast is 60/2 = 30 feet.
2. The flag moved: 60 feet up (to the top), 30 feet down (to half-mast), 30 feet up (back to the top), and 60 feet down (completely down).
3. The total distance is 60 + 30 + 30 + 60 = 180 feet.

The answer is {180}.

Q: Jo-Bob hopped into the hot air balloon, released the anchor rope, and pulled on the lift chain, which ignited the flame and provided the warm air that caused the balloon to rise. When the lift chain was pulled, the balloon would rise at a rate of 50 feet per minute. But when the chain was not being pulled, the balloon would slowly descend at a rate of 10 feet per minute. During his balloon ride, he pulled the chain for 15 minutes, then released the rope for 10 minutes, then pulled the chain for another 15 minutes, and finally released the chain and allowed the balloon to slowly descend back to the earth. During his balloon ride, what was the highest elevation reached by the balloon?
A: Let's break down this problem:
1. How high did the balloon rise during the first chain pull?
2. How much did the balloon descend when the chain was released?
3. How high did the balloon rise during the second chain pull?
4. What was the highest elevation reached?

1. The first 15-minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise 50 x 15 = 750 feet.
2. Releasing the chain for 10 minutes caused the balloon to descend 10 x 10 = 100 feet.
3. The second 15-minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise another 50 x 15 = 750 feet.
4. At the end of the second chain pull, the balloon was at 750 - 100 + 750 = 1400 feet.

The answer is {1400}."""
